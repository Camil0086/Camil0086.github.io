# Introduction

On this site, you'll find my blog about wood and furniture, both a commercial project created for Meble kolonialne 24 and a graduate project on my studies at the university.

Together with the blog, I give you a simple noncommercial manual, also created at the university, of how to install and configure Visual Studio Code and GitHub Desktop.

On the left sidebar, you'll find both of the above and also, related to the latter, an online help from which you can learn:
* basic syntax of Markdown
* how to publish your first repository to GitHub and introduce changes to it
* how to download up-to-date files from GitHub
* how to invite a collaborator to your repository

You can also count on a few tips and hints for VSCode and solutions to typical problems during GitHub configuration.

In case of any more information necessary, below you'll find documentation for:
* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs)
* [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/)
* [GitHub Desktop](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop)
* [GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en)
