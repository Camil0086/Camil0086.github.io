Team project 
==================

This is a noncommercial project created as one of the graduation projects on Jagiellonian University.

It was run by a team of six people including me. I was a team leader and a tester. 
* as a leader I was responsible for contacts with project manager and coordination of team work
* as a tester I have prepared and run two exploratory test sessions during which I have found seven bugs

The purpose of this project was to prepare a sample of our team capabilities and deliver it to stakeholders. Tests were performed on [Krak√≥w Department of Municipal Waste Management [MPO]](https://mpo.krakow.pl/pl/main) sites.
