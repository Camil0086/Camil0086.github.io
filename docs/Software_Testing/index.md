# Introduction

On this site, you'll find my commercial and noncommercial projects related to software testing and quality assurance.

* a blog prepared for Meble kolonialne 24 - A commercial project prepared and created in DITA / Oxygen
* a QA report created for Meble kolonialne 24 - Another commercial project commissioned by the company and created as part of the reference materials for the Software Testing course at Jagiellonian University (Krak√≥w) in which I have used exploratory technics to search and define functional and visual flaws of the e-shop   
* also, as a noncommercial project, I give you a report created together with my team at the university in which I was a project manager and a tester
