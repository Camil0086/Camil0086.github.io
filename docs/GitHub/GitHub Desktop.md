## GitHub Desktop installation guide
Visit [GitHub Desktop download link](https://desktop.github.com) and choose the proper OS System. Download and install GitHub Desktop. 

## GitHub first steps
After GitHub Desktop installation, open the client and follow the below steps:
1. After the first run please click **Authorise desktop** to authorise GitHub Desktop 
2. Choose **Create a New Repository on your hard drive...** on start-up page or **File => New repository** in the top menu.
3. Type the **Name** and **Description**
4. Carefully choose the **Local path** of your repository. Although you can change the path, it is good practice to choose as short path as possible and don't change it after creating a repository. 
5. Mark **Initialize this repository with a README**. Although it is not essential, it will create a readme file together with the repository. It contains the description you typed in the second step.
6. Leave **Git ignore** and **License** as it is.
7. Click **Create repository**

You have created your first repository. Choose **Repository => Show in Explorer** in the top menu to view your repository. You can also find it on your hard drive by the path you have chosen.
